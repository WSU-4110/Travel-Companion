        <p class="fw-semibold">We are working to build a Travel Companion website capable of accompanying a traveler from 
                trip conception until their eventual return home. Being able to assist our users throughout all aspects of their trip is our most important priority. Providing
                tools and features tailored to make anyones experience in an unfamiliar place more enjoyable by removing the hastle of constantly navigating different applications 
                and tools in their phones. Our Travel Comapnion seeks to encapsulate any tools or utilities a traveler would need when planning their trip, on their trip, or remembering
                their trip. </p>
